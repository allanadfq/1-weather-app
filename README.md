# [Weather-App](https://1-weather-app.netlify.app/) 🌦

This project was inspired by [app-ideas repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). A simple app, for you search how it's the current weather on a city. I'm using ReactJS with Axios and to get the info about the weather I used the [AccuWeather APIs](https://developer.accuweather.com/) (the negative point about this API you only can make 50 calls/day on a free packages).

## Status
The most important it's done, you can search for a city. But, I want to add more things:
* A warning if the city you looking doesn't exist;
* Show a warning if the numbers of call/day is over;
* Show some forecast about the city searched;
* Maybe save the last city searched in localstorage;
* Add animations/transitions
* And make the code cleaner

## Final Considerations
This "little" project was my first-real project on github (that's not true but actually it is 🙄). When I challenged myself to do this project had everything perfect designed in my head 🤪take access to API, make some requests, show the responses on screen and boom E A S Y🤪 but that's not what happend. First of all, almost lost my mind with the API's documentation, but, after clearing my mind it flowed all the way. The next was when I was coding and thinking how should I a structured the components and where put my hooks and how the gonna effect the app. Last but not least, how to import imgs from the local based on a index, I ended using required (don't know if it's a good way to do). Once said in status, I want to make the code more cleaner. And the most valued thing i'm taking is that the documentation is my best friend.
