# [Weather-App](https://1-weather-app.netlify.app/) ðŸŒ¦

This project was inspired by app-ideas repo(https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). A simple app, for you search how it's the current weather on a city. 

## Status
The most important it's done, you can search for a city. But, I want to add more things:
* A warning if the city you looking doesn't exist;
* Maybe save the last city in localstorage;
* Add animations/transitions
* Show some forecast about the city searched;
